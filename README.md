> **"All content is equal. We simply prefer the ones that are more equal than others."**

FODDER is not a tool; it is a clinical partition. In an era where the digital estate is flooded with industrial-grade filler and synthetic runoff, FODDER provides the forensic lens required to separate the sovereign from the swine.

## 🔬 The v4.0 "Clinical Precision" Protocol

The v4.0 architecture represents a shift from metadata observation to **Linguistic DNA Auditing**. We have moved beyond the "trough" of standard filtering to implement a high-reasoning forensic suite.

### The Sovereign Engine (Pro Core)
* **Linguistic Forensics (Slop Density v2)**: A cold, non-generative heuristic scanner. It identifies the "Synthetic Mash" fingerprints—repetitive lexical clusters and robotic "GPT-isms"—calculating a real-time **SLP %** (Slop Percentage) for every frame.
* **Audience Drift Analysis**: A sentiment-decay monitor. By contrasting the established consensus (Top 25) against live signals (Recent 50), FODDER identifies inorganic bot clusters and factual rot flagged by the human collective.
* **Transcriptive Sovereignty**: Bypasses the "Digital Fences" of browser-side CORB/TrustedHTML blocks. Utilizing the **Supadata API**, it retrieves raw transcript data directly from the source for clinical deconstruction.

## 🎯 The Hierarchy of the Estate

FODDER applies a weighted, surgical lens to categorize your feed into three dietary tiers:

### The Taxonomy of the Trough
* 🟢 **THE SOVEREIGN (70-100)**: "Certified Human." High-density cognitive protein. Zero-additive human perspective. Safe for intellectual harvest.
* 🟡 **THE CHAFF (40-69)**: "Filler-Grade." Processed digital carbohydrates. High-calorie, low-nutrient content designed for the herd.
* 🔴 **THE MASH (0-39)**: "Synthetic Runoff." AI-generated slurry. Produced by machines, for cattle. **DO NOT CONSUME.**

### The Forensic Calculus
The **Humanity Score** is determined by the internal Logic Core using a weighted multi-variate equation:

$$composite = 0.45 \cdot DNA + 0.25 \cdot VEL + 0.20 \cdot INT + 0.10 \cdot VOL$$

* **Approval DNA (45%)**: Bayesian sentiment rating calibrated to sovereign-level standards.
* **Growth Velocity (25%)**: Momentum metrics relative to the channel’s biological baseline.
* **Signal Integrity (20%)**: Interaction density; the primary detector for inorganic bot manipulation.
* **Volume Magnitude (10%)**: Logarithmic scaling of raw engagement signals.

## 🔧 Installation & Handshake

To maintain the forensic integrity of the Sovereign Plan, FODDER requires a "Handshake" with external logic providers:

1.  **Clone the Estate**: Download the repository.
2.  **Initialize Protocol**: Load the unpacked folder via `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  **Secure the Keys**: Access the Popup Menu to input your credentials:
    * **OpenRouter API**: Powers the "Clinical Insights" via DeepSeek V3.
    * **YouTube Data API**: Required for "Audience Drift" forensic mapping.
    * **Supadata API**: The "Sovereignty Engine" for raw transcript extraction.

## 🔮 The Sommelier’s Verdict

| Tier | Status | Clinical Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sovereign** | "Certified Human" | High-yield narrative detected. Refined cognitive output. |
| **Chaff** | "Filler-Grade" | Industrial additives detected. Common digital carbohydrate. |
| **Mash** | "Synthetic Runoff" | AI Slurry. Potential for cognitive atrophy. **CULL RECOMMENDED.** |
