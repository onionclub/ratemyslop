## 🔬 The v4 "Clinical Precision" Overhaul

FODDER v4.0 is a complete architectural reset. While v3 focused on "Lumina" aesthetics, v4 establishes the **Intelligence Sovereignty** required to surface expert signal in an ocean of AI-generated noise. This release introduces the "Pro Core"—features designed for deep-dive analysis that will form the backbone of future premium tiers.

### The "Clinical" Pro Suite (Early Access)
- **Slop Density Engine v2**: A heuristic linguistic scanner that detects AI fingerprints (overuse of terms like "delve," "tapestry," and sycophantic openers). It outputs a specific **SLP %** on every video.
- **Audience Drift**: AI-powered contrast analysis. By comparing the **Top 25** (established consensus) against the **Recent 50** (live signals), FODDER identifies sentiment decay, factual errors flagged by late viewers, or inorganic bot manipulation.
- **Transcriptive Sovereignty**: Bypasses YouTube’s TrustedHTML and CORB security blocks by utilizing a server-side proxy (**Supadata API**) to retrieve raw, clean data for analysis.

## 🎯 Scoring & Tiering

FODDER applies a cold, weighted lens to every video:

### The Tier System
- 🟢 **ORGANIC (70-100)** — "Certified Fresh." Pure human signal.
- 🟡 **FILLER (40-69)** — "Edible." Processed, high-calorie filler content.
- 🔴 **SYNTHETIC (0-39)** — "Bio-Hazard." AI-generated slurry. **DO NOT CONSUME.**

### The Mathematics (v4.0)
The **Humanity Score** is calculated through independent weighted metrics:
$$composite = 0.45 \cdot DNA + 0.25 \cdot VEL + 0.20 \cdot INT + 0.10 \cdot VOL$$

* **Approval DNA (45%)**: Bayesian sentiment rating calibrated to expert-level community standards.
* **Growth Velocity (25%)**: Performance momentum relative to the channel's established base.
* **Signal Integrity (20%)**: Interaction density; the primary detector for inorganic bot clusters.
* **Volume Magnitude (10%)**: Logarithmic scaling of raw engagement signals.

## 🔮 The Sommelier’s Voice

FODDER maintains a satirical, clinical distance from the content it audits:

| Tier | Verdict | Clinical Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Organic** | "Certified Fresh" | High signal, pure content detected. Safe for intellectual consumption. |
| **Filler** | "Edible" | Processed, caloric but empty. Contains common digital additives. |
| **Synthetic** | "Bio-Hazard" | AI slurry detected. Handle with extreme caution. **DO NOT CONSUME.** |
